## My Education

During my **high school** years I had no idea what kind of study I wanted to do, because nothing really interested me enough to want to delve deeper into it. So I studied **math and sciences**, not knowing how well it would turn out later.

After high school I graduated with a **graduate degree in programming**. However, I wanted something __more interactive and responsive__ than being a **web/app developer**.

This brings us to the present. I am currently studying **Game Development in Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) at the Howest University of Applied Sciences**. I had seen this study before but had put aside because I felt like I __lacked the creativity__ to make it in this field. What I didn't think about at the time was of course that **Game Development** is not something you do alone. I enjoyed the programming itself from my previous study and I had a background in math and physics from high school, so I decided to give it a chance and I could not be happier that I did.
