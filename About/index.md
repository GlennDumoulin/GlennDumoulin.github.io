# About Me

## My name is Glenn Dumoulin

I was born and raised in Belgium and I'm a **game developer** focussing mostly on **gameplay programming**.

Games have always been a part of my life and I feel blessed to even have the opportunity to be a part of this industry! I found myself thinking about possible game mechanics, features and even possible solutions to issues I had when playing games or when encountering bugs. This was already happening way before I discovered <a href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/" target="_blank">Digital Arts and Entertainment</a>, but now I think about it in a more professional and critical way.

## My Education

During my **high school** years I had no idea what kind of study I wanted to do, because nothing really interested me enough to want to delve deeper into it. So I studied **math and sciences**, not knowing how well it would turn out later.

After high school I graduated with a **graduate degree in programming**. However, I wanted something _more interactive and responsive_ than being a **web/app developer**.

This brings us to the present. I am currently studying **Game Development in Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) at the Howest University of Applied Sciences**. I had seen this study before but had put aside because I felt like I _lacked the creativity_ to make it in this field. What I didn't think about at the time was of course that **Game Development** is not something you do alone. I enjoyed the programming itself from my previous study and I had a background in math and physics from high school, so I decided to give it a chance and I could not be happier that I did.

## My Hobbies

I like to spend my time doing things like:

- Dancing
- Playing games & board games
- Acting
- Spending time with friends & family

And I should also mention programming, but I would rather do some of the other things mentioned above and keep programming _mainly_ for professional use.

I have also done a few other hobbies in the past such as:

- Judo
- Youth theater
- Djembé

Some of these I did longer than others but I have always enjoyed them for as long as I did them.
