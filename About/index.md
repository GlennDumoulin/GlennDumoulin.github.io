# About Me

## My name is Glenn Dumoulin

I was born and raised in Belgium and I'm a **game developer** focussing mostly on **gameplay programming**.

Games have always been a part of my life and I feel blessed to even have the opportunity to be a part of this industry! I found myself thinking about possible game mechanics, features and even possible solutions to issues I had when playing games or when encountering bugs. This was already happening way before I discovered <a href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/" target="_blank">Digital Arts and Entertainment</a>, but now I think about it in a more professional and critical way.

## My Education

During my **high school** years I had no idea what kind of study I wanted to do, because nothing really interested me enough to want to delve deeper into it. So I studied **math and sciences**, not knowing how well it would turn out later.

After high school I graduated with a **graduate degree in programming**. However, I wanted to do something that is a bit more _more interactive and responsive_ than being a **web/app developer**.

That led me to study **Game Development in Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) at the Howest University of Applied Sciences**. Suprisingly both my prior educations actually introduced me already to some **key parts** of Game Development. I discovered and enjoyed the programming itself from my previous study and I had a background in math and physics from my high school studies.

I am well aware of the concept of **lifelong learning** that is applied in these fields and I am very open to discovering and learning many more things in the future, but I do have to say "I hope the school part of my life is finally over!"

## My Hobbies

I like to spend my time doing things like:

- Dancing
- Playing games & board games
- Acting
- Spending time with friends & family

And I will also mention programming, but I prefer keeping busy with my other hobbies and keep programming _mainly_ for professional use.

I have also done a few other hobbies in the past such as:

- Judo
- Youth theater
- Djembé

Some of these I did longer than others but I have always enjoyed them for as long as I did them.
